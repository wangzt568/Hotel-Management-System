What does a hotel business need to survive in a competitive market? At least two things: Have an online presence that makes the reservation process easier and deliver outstanding customer service so that visitors returning to your area will choose your location again. Automating daily operations and administrative tasks is an important part of achieving customer satisfaction as it helps provide reliable and quality service time after time. A hotel is a complex system that encompasses the activities of many departments, and every operation must be tracked. For this purpose, hoteliers utilize various tools including spreadsheets, paper forms, and unified hotel management systems.

What is a hotel management system?

A **hotel management system (HMS)** is software that facilitates a hotel’s reservation management and administrative tasks. The most important functions include front-desk operations, reservations, channel management, housekeeping, rate and occupancy management, and payment processing.  Although PMS software mostly controls reservation and financial transactions, it may allow you to manage housekeeping and perform human resources management as well. In general, PMS facilitates the main processes in a hotel related to internal and external operations.

*Hotel Hotel Management System (PMS): Functions, Modules & Integrations*

The first hotel hotel management systems were introduced back in the 1970s. But, even today not every hotel has one. A report [“Hotel Management Software BuyerView”](https://www.softwareadvice.com/hotel-management/buyerview/report-2015/) by Software Advice shows that in 2015 only 34 percent of hotels used special software, while 25 percent still relied on pen and paper only to manage their hotels, and 16 percent had no hotel management system at all. The report is based on data from 385 owners of independent hotels, motels, inns, resorts, and other types of a hotel hotel in the US.

So, plenty of hotels still use Excel, a paper-and-pen format, or legacy software none of which fulfill the needs of a 21st century hotel. Legacy PMS software may perform just one function, require additional modules, or be too hard to integrate with other necessary hotel management software. Consequently, hotel owners are looking for a universal, one-and-done solution to manage all the processes.

Currently, hotel hotel management systems are used by big hotel chains, small hostels, and everything in between. With these systems, hotels can see the booking status of rooms and control reservations. However, their functionality doesn’t end here. Via PMS, hoteliers can manage back-office processes, food and beverage services, and track room occupation rates. Let’s take a closer look at the most common functions supported by PMS.

Main modules of hotel management systems

A modern hotel management system combines multiple work environments in a single piece of software. Depending on the provider, the combination of modules and functions can vary, and the functionality of one module can be slightly different. Additionally, some vendors sell their systems in separate modules that can be integrated with an existing solution used by a hotel. Here is the basic structure of a hotel PMS.

![pms outline](file:///C:/Users/11512/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.jpg)

*A general structure of hotel management system*

Keep in mind that it is hard to divide the functions of PMS into more and less important because all of them are necessary. However, regardless of a hotel type, hotel hotel management systems must have a reservation system with a website booking engine and front-desk operations module. Other essential modules usually include channel management, revenue management, housekeeping, customer data management, report, and analytics. And big hotels or resorts certainly need point-of-sale (POS) services and back-office modules.

Reservation

For a modern hotel business, online bookings are in most cases the main sales channel. The reservation module, which helps manage online bookings, effectively becomes indispensable to a hotel management system. A central reservation system (CRS) or any other reservation platform may be available as a separate module of PMS or implemented as a hotel’s separate internal solution.

A hotel reservation system holds all inventory data and dates, sending this information to the front desk. The reservation system must be integrated with the website booking engine and other distribution channels. Chain hotels usually have one central reservation system for all properties, while independent hotels have their own reservation systems. If a hotel or a hotel chain already uses a particular reservation software, PMS must offer integration with the existing service.

Key functions of the reservation module include:

- **Room bookings.** The system checks room availability and status, shows     free rooms across different channels and the website booking engine. This     function monitors double bookings and allows group reservations. Then it     schedules bookings and displays information about current and upcoming     bookings on a dashboard.
- **Collection of e-payments**, and identification of types and categories of     payments that are processed via this module.
- **Management of room inventory     and allocation** that prevents     overbookings and duplication of bookings. In some software, this function     is part of a channel management module.
- **Reservation emails**. The system sends confirmations to guests after they     complete booking. In some PMSs, this function is a part of the front-desk     operations module.
- **Activities booking**. Some software allows guests to book not only     accommodation but also activities with this system.

Front-desk operations

A front-office module allows a front-desk manager to view and update room reservation status, check guests in and out, and process payments. When a guest arrives at the hotel, they want to check in as fast as possible. Support from a receptionist is very important in this case, so front-desk staff should have time to help the guest. Some hotel management systems offer integration into check-in kiosks or allow checking in or out via QR code. To get a better idea of check-in automation, have a look at how Marriott and other businesses leverage [digital self-services in travel](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/digital-transformation-stories-how-jetblue-and-marriott-advance-travel-experience/).

**Room management.** One of the capabilities that this module provides is room management. Using a front-desk module, the front-office manager can access room status and up-to-date information about all reservations, both current and upcoming. With the help of this module, room status should be updated quickly. The front-desk module allocates rooms automatically and facilitates a room change. This module includes management of electronic key cards, processing payments and issuing receipts to guests. The front-office module also allows users to perform night and shift audits.

Channel management

[Channel management software](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/hotel-channel-managers-key-providers-and-how-to-choose-a-channel-manager/) is a single interface to control and distribute inventories across different channels such as GDSs, OTAs, wholesalers, [direct booking](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/travel/how-to-drive-direct-bookings-online-back-to-your-hotel/) platforms, etc. A channel manager connects directly to a central reservation system that holds information about the availability and cost of hotel rooms, sharing this information via the distribution channels. It makes room inventory available to travelers who want to book a room or hotel online, listing rooms on different sources. Also, a channel management module facilitates booking-related transactions.

Different distribution channels expose the inventory to different audiences. For example, connection to OTAs and some airline websites allow a larger number of potential guests to be reached, those who book flights or plan trips in advance. Metasearch sites compare prices across different channels, letting a customer make the best decision. Connections to global distribution systems assist non-leisure traveler booking as well as group reservations.

Another channel of distribution is a website booking engine. An online booking engine allows travelers to complete reservations directly via a hotel website bypassing travel agents and OTAs. It’s important to allow loyal guests to book directly, and website booking must be available to those who find a hotel online. A booking engine must be synchronized with the hotel website and its central reservation system, making it an additional sales channel. Usually, this module processes payments via integrated payment gateways.

Revenue management

A PMS in and of itself is a big step towards improving [hotel revenue ](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/hotel-revenue-management-solutions-best-practices-revenue-managers-role/)[management](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/hotel-revenue-management-solutions-best-practices-revenue-managers-role/) indicators, such as *Occupancy*, *RevPAR* (Revenue per Available Room), and *ADR* (Average Daily Rate), which mean a lot in evaluating a hotel’s financial success. While GDS and OTA integration helps maximize these rates, revenue management systems help a manager understand how to adjust the processes to achieve better results and control finances. This module helps increase total revenue of rooms using forecasting to optimize occupancy, deciding whether to raise or lower inventory prices.

The revenue management module enables dynamic pricing. Using algorithms, this module helps hotels price the rooms based on historical data about past reservations as it monitors competitors’ rates, weather data, and local events. It improves pricing strategies, and updates prices across all distribution channels to sell more rooms at the optimal rate. To learn more about revenue management read our article on how [machine learning redefines revenue management](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/datascience/machine-learning-redefines-revenue-management-and-dynamic-pricing-in-hotel-industry/) in the hotel industry.

Housekeeping

PMS housekeeping module connects housekeeping staff to the front office. A front-office manager can make a list of tasks to assign, and housekeepers can update room status. If this is a cloud-based PMS, housekeepers can update the status of their assignments or rooms through a mobile app or tablet.  Also, this module keeps the list of maintenance tasks and reports for the users.

The main function of this module is housekeeping management and hotel maintenance. Housekeeping functionality includes management of room status, maid assignment for room cleaning based on a block or floor location, keeping lists of tasks for housekeepers. Maintenance management keeps the record of hotel disruptions and repairs with the further assignment of an attendant who can eliminate a problem.

CRM and customer data management

It is critical for hoteliers to collect and organize guest data to keep in touch with current and past customers during and after check-out. The CRM module must integrate with the front desk and reservation system, collecting all guest information from these sources. It helps store guest data and provides a database in an accessible format. Also, it includes guest contact information before and after their stay. However, if a hotel already has its own CRM system, the PMS should integrate with it.

This module can also help organize marketing and promotions, measure guest experience, and pre- and post-stay services. The CRM module helps owners personalize the guest experience with membership and loyalty programs, which are especially important for hotel chains and resorts.

Reports and analytics

To monitor current processes and understand business performance, rely on analytics. A PMS can serve as a business intelligence tool, collecting relevant data and providing hoteliers with various types of automated reports. Depending on the software, it can generate night audit reports, room and tax reports, shift audit reports, departure/arrival reports, housekeeping reports, or other ongoing reporting.

Back-office management

This PMS module facilitates management of a hotel team, back-office operations, and administrative hotel operations. Functions of a back-office management module may include:

- Event management (conference     and reception organization) and catering
- Spa and gym management
- Staff management (human     resources management in back and front office: shift management, staff     invoicing)
- Consumption costs and hotel     spendings analysis
- Inventory analysis
- Sales and management of     promotional campaigns
- Reviews management.

PMSs that have this module included enable users to manage campaigns and send emails, as well as report a guest’s exact arrival time. This function may include internal messaging, and in some cases, accounting.

Point-of-sale services

If there are multiple point-of-sale terminals in a hotel, this function is indispensable to handle transactions. It automates transactions and keeps financial data in one place. Most hotels have some kind of restaurant on the premises, not to mention properties with gyms and spas. With a PMS, hoteliers can include additional costs or discounts to the final bill for each customer. Additional costs may include:

- Spa, gyms, and activities
- Food and beverage services     (restaurants, cafes, breakfasts)
- In-room services, mini-bar     items, TV, or Wi-Fi.

Things to consider when choosing PMS software

The choice of a PMS depends on the size and type of a hotel hotel, as different systems have their own sets of core features and additional modules. Most players in the market offer hotel management systems that can be customized for different types of hotel and basic modules of PMS can be complemented with additional modules, required for a specific type of business.

Many properties already have reservation platforms or CRS of their own, or they already utilize certain software, so it is very important for the selected PMS to be integrable with third-party services. The final choice of a hotel management system for a hotel is largely shaped by the functionality required.

[*The 2019 Smart Decision Guide to Hotel Hotel Management Systems*](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/dc/guide-hotel-property-oracle.pdf?elqTrackId=0d2d03a5747d4d018834d79d64492d40&elqaid=77117&elqat=2) by Oracle provides an evaluation checklist to help hoteliers make the right decision, scaling each factor from 1 (absolutely not important) to 10 (very important). This checklist is also very useful for comparing systems by different vendors. But regardless of hotel size and type, consider the following:

![Hotel PMS checklist](file:///C:/Users/11512/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.jpg)*The Evaluation Checklist
 Source:* [*The 2019 Smart Decision Guide for to Hotel Hotel Management Systems*](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/dc/guide-hotel-property-oracle.pdf?elqTrackId=0d2d03a5747d4d018834d79d64492d40&elqaid=77117&elqat=2)

**Check integration options.** If there are systems already used by a hotel, or if you plan on integrating additional software, make sure that your vendor supports all necessary APIs and is ready to provide integration services. If you already use a CRM system, it’s better to look for a PMS that can be directly integrated with it. Otherwise, you may consider an external technical consultant to provide integration services.

**Cloud solution with mobile access.** Cloud solutions are generally less expensive than on-premise software, and an owner doesn`t need to pay maintenance fees. Users of cloud software pay a [subscription fee](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/software-business-models-examples-revenue-streams-and-characteristics-for-products-services-and-platforms/) depending on the number of rooms in a hotel and can pay only for the modules they use. Also, cloud software is better at integrating with third-party systems like OTAs and GDSs. On top of that, cloud-based systems can be constantly and seamlessly updated, and usually present in mobile version.The presence of a mobile or tablet version facilitates communication across departments, front-office, management, housekeeping, and advancing guest service.

 *Mobile interface of a hotel PMS
 Source:* [*Oracle*](https://www.oracle.com/industries/hospitality/hotel-property-management/mobile.html)

**Prioritize the ease of use.** The interface of a PMS shouldn’t be too complicated to use and integrate. The quality of system’s [UX](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/uxdesign/ux-vs-ui-design-stages-participants-roles-and-skills/) will impact your employees’ learning curve. The more complex and unintuitive the interface is, the more time you have to invest in staff training and transitioning.

**Pay attention to the degree of customization offered by a provider.** Depending on the size and type of a hotel, PMS requirements may differ. For instance, if you need a bed-based management system instead of room-based in the front-office module, make sure that the PMS vendor can provide this sort of customization.

**Assess customer support.** Anything can happen to software, but it mustn’t affect the hotel service. Hoteliers need 24/7 access to technical support. When choosing a PMS, look for customer support reviews from fellow hoteliers or negotiate all support terms with your vendor in detail to ensure that any software outages won’t have a dramatic impact on your operations**.**

**Calculate ROI and spendings.** Whether you want to update an existing hotel management system, build a custom one, or buy an off-the-shelf solution, you need to decide how much you’re ready to spend on it. To make sure that the PMS will pay off, consider these key factors: time currently spent and how it will be reduced as a result of automation, how distribution and revenue will change, and cost of system integration and maintenance.

There are plenty of vendors who sell off-the-shelf PMS, and those who provide customization services. Trying to reach a broader audience, big vendors supplement and customize the basic PMS so that they can be used by as many types of properties as possible. Let’s have a look at the solutions across different categories. Please note that some systems already have channel management, reservation, and front-office functionality, so these modules are not represented in some of these tables of comparison.

Hotel management systems for hotel chains and resorts

Larger properties require solutions with a wide range of modules other than the basic reservation, front office, and housekeeping. Their PMS must facilitate the option of group bookings, have POS-services, a multi-hotel management system, back-office management, revenue management, sales, and marketing functionality. Vendors cater to the needs of large properties, adding special modules like golf and spa management. Also, owners of big properties should consider PMS with options that speed up check-in and check-out.

*Hotel management systems for hotel chains and resorts*

For example, such providers as Oracle, Maestro, eZee Technosys, and many more offer PMSs adjustable for hotel properties of all types, from big hotels and resorts to hostels and rental properties. Have a look at the most popular solutions on the market and their feature sets.

Maestro PMS

[Maestro PMS](http://www.maestropms.com/) is a multi-hotel management system that includes 14 modules that can be integrated into one interface. The system provides open API and GDS/OTA integration. The product is positioned as a guest-centered PMS for chain and independent hotels, resorts, and vacation rentals. Maestro PMS is available both as a Windows app and a web browser application. It also has mobile apps for guests and hotel staff. Here’s a brief description of Maestro’s key functionality modules.

**Multi-hotel management.** The cloud-based system allows an owner to access several properties from one device and offers increased data security and a high level of module integration, including those of third parties.

**Front desk operations.** This module connects reservation, housekeeping, spa, activities, and guest relations management modules in a single environment. Also, the front-office functionality includes the Xpress Check-In Wireless module that allows front-office managers to check the guests in and out via an iPad and encode a room key on the spot.  It also has a CRM system functionality.

**Back-office management.** This functionality of Maestro PMS is represented by several modules: The Sales and Catering and the Workorder management module for housekeeping management. The Sales and Catering assists in sales and marketing as well as event planning and management. It facilitates sales and helps keep track of all aspects of event management, conference planning, and scheduling. Workorder management module schedules tasks and maintenance budgeting.

**Revenue management.** Maestro PMS has the Analytics & Business Intelligence datamining module for budgeting, forecasting, marketing, and reporting.

**Spa and activities.** This PMS has a module for resorts, which include the Spa & Activities Management System and Fine Dining Point Of Sale & Table Reservations that integrate billing with the front-office module. This module offers mobile solutions for guests, allowing them to schedule services.

**Guest experience management.** Maestro PMS offers several modules, focused on providing an outstanding guest experience (loyalty programs and membership cards), as well as guest experience measurement modules. For example, some membership programs reward certain transactions through the PMS with points that can be used on special services in a hotel. Earning points can be based on criteria like money spent in the hotel or the number of reservations a guest makes. Also, it allows guest preference tracking, updating preferences in a guest profile.

IQware PMS

Another example of a PMS for big properties is the[ IQware Hotel Management System](http://www.iqwareinc.com/products/property-management-system/). It is designed as a multi-hotel management system for properties of all sizes. Its functionality can be applied to resorts, condos, villas, vacation rentals, campgrounds, marina-resorts, and extended stays. Like Maestro PMS, this software focuses on guest experience and offers group-booking opportunities, and a customizable guest app that facilitates check-ins/outs. IQware PMS also has The Package Management module for all-inclusive resorts or business trips.

The main functionality of this system includes:

**Revenue management.** The main difference from Maestro PMS is the management of commissions for travel agencies, GDS, tour operators, hotel staff, or sales office. The revenue management module of IQware PMS has 5 levels of revenue control.

**Reservation management.** PMS has group management in its reservation module, and another special feature is the allotment module that blocks the rooms for companies, airlines or tour operators, and travel agents. Also, IQware PMS calculates travel agent commissions automatically.

**Channel management and billing.** Connection to GDS is possible with the IQlink Channel Management Tool. The other optional modules of PMS are Activity Booking, and Work Order Billing, which allows paying for separate services in different properties.

**Modules for other hotel types.** Timeshare Management, Vacation Club Management, Condo-Hotel Management, and Marina Management modules may be particularly relevant for resorts or apartment buildings. They expand a standard list of features with functions like activities booking, or a customized maintenance management module.

Additional on-demand modules of IQware PMS include:

- Central Reservation System
- Hospitality’s Email Service
- Spa Management Platform
- Event Management Software
- Travel Insurance for guests

Systems for city hotels, business hotels, conference centers

This category of systems requires the same basic functions as the previous one. However, the critical modules for this group of properties are back-office management with conference and catering functions.

 *Hotel management systems for city hotels, business hotels, conference centers*

Solutions for small hotels (hostels, inns, B&Bs)

Such types of hotel properties don’t require too many options and additional modules, like POS services due to their size and internal structure. The main modules these PMSs should have are usually an online reservation tool and integration to a hotel`s existing reservation platform. Because small hotels may need slightly different functions, the PMS should offer a high level of customization.

 *Hotel management systems for small hotels, hostels, inns, B&Bs*

Little Hotelier

[Little Hotelier](https://www.littlehotelier.com/) is a cloud-based solution for small hotel properties like B&Bs, hostels, and guesthouses. The PMS is powered by SiteMinder and integrates with this reservation platform. However, it also allows third-party integrations. Little Hotelier combines all necessary modules for a hotel in one PMS:

- Front desk management
- Reservation management
- Channel manager with online     booking engine.

Also, LittleHotelier is available in an application and has a website builder.

This PMS allows for creating not only online reservations, but also reservations by phone or walk-ins that can be made via the front office. The channel manager of Little Hotelier distributes properties to more than 250 booking channels including connection to Airbnb and provides a channel analysis report.

Little Hotelier’s dashboard allows for viewing how the channels are tracked. All PMS data can be accessed from a single place, like a tablet, smartphone or desktop. For example, a hotel manager can see the list of today`s check-ins and check-outs, get a guest-coming notification, and print invoices.

Hotelogix

Another PMS for small properties is [Hotelogix](https://www.hotelogix.com/). However, this PMS also be suitable for hotels and resorts. It has a strong channel management module, third-party integration with reservation platforms, and offers customization. For example, a vendor can offer a bed-based reservation management system for hostels instead of room-based.

Hotelogix PMS offers a Facebook online engine and mobile access from the app that allows management of a hotel`s team. Interfaces of both Little Hotelier and Hotelogix are available in ten languages, and process transactions in different currencies. One more interesting feature of Hotelogix is online reputation management, created in cooperation with TripAdvisor. This tool allows for automating guest feedback collection, so that managers can react and reply faster.

What’s the future of hotel PMS?

Technologies in the hospitality industry are constantly developing, offering new functions and modules to optimize daily operations. So what’s going on with them now?

In a recent [techtalk.travel podcast “Evolution of PMS”](https://www.techtalk.travel/post/podcast-evolution-pms) top managers and founders of hospitality businesses highlighted the following ways for hotel hotel management systems’ development:

**Transition to Marketplace model.** Today PMS integration seems like a hard labor (and it is): Besides a channel manager and other internal modules, described in this article, the PMSs must integrate with multiple [guest service technologies](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/hospitality-connectivity-landscape-choosing-solutions-for-your-hotel/), so a hotel ends up with dozens of apps, attached to a system. They are hard to manage and integrate. There are two options to relieve this pain: the first one is to get access to PMS’s partner solutions and advance the solution. The second one is a platform where a customer can find solutions compatible with their PMS.

**API-first approach.** As experts predict, new-generation hotel management systems will switch towards cloud and open API platforms, which will lead to a better connection between different modules and will sufficiently improve the speed and quality of data exchange.

**AI-powered solutions.** The hospitality industry already adopts AI and Data Science – you can find out more about it in this [comprehensive article](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/datascience/how-the-hospitality-industry-uses-performance-enhancing-artificial-intelligence-and-data-science/). Hotel hotel management systems are no exception, especially if we talk about business intelligence, revenue management, and guest service ([chatbots](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/chatbots-for-hotels/) and e-concierges).
